## Code Instructions



The "Code" folder contains two folders. One is Mix\_projects and the other is Cross\_projects. 
The Mixed-projects folder contains the Python code samples which implements a mix-project detection for the purpose of evaluating network performance.
The Cross-projects folder contains the Python code samples which use 8 projects for training a vulnerability detector for detection on the remaining project. 

1. LoadCFilesAsText.py is to split the C files into textual sequences. A non-vulnerability function file is labeled as 0, and a vulnerability function file is labeled as 1. The result is saved as a .pkl file.
2. Embedding.py is to convert code tokens to vector representations. We use word2vec model for generating representations. The outputs are saved in a .txt and .pkl file.
3. DNN\_embedding\_model\_GPU.py, GRU\_model\_GPU.py, LSTM\_model\_GPU.py, BiGRU\_model\_GPU.py, BiLSTM\_model\_GPU.py, Text\_CNN\_model\_GPU.py are all the neural models selected for evaluation.
4. Train\_BiGRU.py file contains the code for implementing training a Bi-GRU network.
