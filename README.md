## Function-level Vulnerability Dataset

Hi there, welcome to this repository!

This repository contains a subset of code and data used in an evaluation of using 6 mainstream neural network models for function-level vulnerability detection. We have detailed the data collection and evaluation processes in a paper which is currently under review. When the review process is completed, we will publish all the data and code used.
